## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used different selectors and I reinforced my skills and knowledge in CSS grid and flexbox. I also learned how to use the transition correctly

```css
button:hover {
	cursor: pointer;
	transform: scale(1.1);
	transition: transform ease-out 0.3s;
}
```

### Continued development

I hope to get better at animations and make more interesting pages with animations.
